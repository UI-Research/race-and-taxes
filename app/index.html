        <p>
          The Internal Revenue Service does not ask for a tax filer’s race or ethnicity on tax forms, but that does not mean the tax system affects people of different races in the same way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, federal income taxes are <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/are-federal-taxes-progressive">progressive</a>: those with higher incomes pay a larger share of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes, and this can help close racial income gaps. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But some tax policies can also exacerbate <a href="http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/">income and wealth inequalities</a> stemming from <a href="https://next50.urban.org/question/structural-racism">long-standing discrimination</a> in areas such as housing, education, and employment. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          Using the individual income tax Form 1040 as a guide, we explore how the federal income tax code interacts with existing racial inequities.

                  Tax liabilities depend on a taxpayer's filing status, meaning whether a taxpayer is married or single and, if single, whether he or she lives with children or other dependents. Single taxpayers with children or other dependents are considered heads of household. Couples who marry may face <a href="https://tpc-marriage-calculator.urban.org/">financial penalties or bonuses</a>. <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/better-flowers-and-chocolate-tpc-releases-its-updated-marriage-penalty-and-bonus-calculator">Dual-earner couples with similar incomes</a> are more likely to face a marriage penalty, paying more income tax as a married couple than they would if they each filed separately. Dual‐earner couples with disparate incomes, on the other hand, are more likely to get a marriage bonus, paying less income tax as a married couple than they would if they each filed separately. Under current law, many more couples receive marriage bonuses than incur penalties from filing jointly.

                  In 2019, just over half of all White households were married couples, compared with 60 percent of Asian households, 48 percent of Hispanic households, and 27 percent of Black households. Black households had the largest shares of parents with no partner present and of people living alone.

                  A Social Security number (SSN) is a crucial identifier for people in the United States. It is used to track earnings and years worked to determine eligibility for Social Security benefits, unemployment insurance, and many public assistance programs. Most taxpayers use an SSN as an identifier on their individual income tax returns. Taxpayers ineligible for SSNs, such as undocumented immigrants and certain other noncitizens, generally file taxes using an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin#itin">Individual Taxpayer Identification Number</a> (ITIN) issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Applying for or renewing ITINs, however, can be <a href="https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/news/nta-blog-ITIN-Improvements">particularly challenging</a>.
                </p>

                  In 2017, around <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/us-unauthorized-immigrant-population-2017/">10.5 million people</a> in the United States were undocumented immigrants, though estimates vary. Most came from Mexico and Central America and resided in the most populous states, with a median stay of over 15 years. Over 70 percent of undocumented immigrants were in the labor force; they constitute about 5 percent of the total US labor force.

                <p>
                  Many undocumented immigrants pay income taxes on their wages, often through withholding on their paychecks. These immigrants often file income tax returns through an <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/why-do-we-make-it-so-hard-immigrants-pay-their-taxes">especially complicated filing process</a>. Further, undocumented taxpayers have contributed <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf">billions in payroll taxes</a> while remaining ineligible for Social Security benefits or most other tax or nontax public benefits.

                  Several federal income tax provisions are connected to a taxpayer's age. For example, taxpayers age 65 or older in 2019 have a slightly higher income threshold for filing taxes because they may increase their <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-standard-deduction">standard deduction</a> by an additional $1,650 (for single or head-of-household filers). They may also claim a nonrefundable <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/credit-elderly-and-disabled-ff04152019">credit for the elderly and disabled</a>, though relatively few taxpayers do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Age distribution among taxpayers varies widely by race and ethnicity: the median age for Asian people is 37, compared with 34 for Black people, 30 for Hispanic people, and 44 for White people. About two-thirds of all Hispanic people and over half of Asian and Black people are either Generation Z or millennials; one-third of all White people are either baby boomers or from the Silent or Greatest Generations.

                  Adjusted gross income (AGI) is the income taxpayers receive from sources such as wages, salaries, interest, or dividends, minus certain expenses such as student loan interest or educator and moving expenses. It is not a comprehensive measure of income; it <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/resources/income-measure-used-distributional-analyses-tax-policy-center">excludes tax-exempt items</a> such as some employee benefits and retirement income. However, the distribution of AGI from <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/return-details-agi-and-marital-status">income tax returns</a> illustrates the income disparity in the US: people with over $100,000 in AGI constitute less than 20 percent of tax returns but report about 60 percent of total AGI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Income disparity is especially wide by race and ethnicity. In 2018, White and Asian households had significantly higher average income (as well as higher income per household member) than Black and Hispanic households. Over half of Black households and almost half of Hispanic households had income below $50,000, compared with 35 percent of White households. Asian households were more likely to have high incomes, but wide income disparities exist among Asian people across <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/22/key-facts-about-asian-origin-groups-in-the-u-s/">national origin</a>.

The federal income tax system helps reduce income inequality because it is <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/are-federal-taxes-progressive">progressive</a> overall: it has a graduated rate structure, a standard deduction, and refundable tax credits.

                  Salary and wages are the largest source of income for low- and middle-income taxpayers: in 2017, they constituted <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/income-salaries-and-wages-ff-12302019">over 70 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI)</a> for taxpayers with AGI under $100,000 but less than 20 percent for those with AGI over $10 million. Wage disparities are particularly striking when comparing the earnings of women of color to those of White men: the <a href="https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/fair-pay/quantifying-americas-gender-wage-gap.pdf">median annual pay</a> for a Black, Hispanic, or Native American woman working a full-time job is about 40 to 45 percent less than that of a White man.

                <p>
                  Asian, Black, and Hispanic people each have larger shares of full-time workers earning <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/workers-of-color-are-far-more-likely-to-be-paid-poverty-level-wages-than-white-workers/">poverty-level wages</a> than White people. Among all people with at least some income from wages and salaries, White and Asian people report higher averages than Black and Hispanic people. The share of White people reporting any wage income is somewhat lower since a larger share of retirees are White.

                  Capital gains are profits from sales of capital assets, such as shares of stock or investments in businesses or land. Capital gains are taxed only when “realized” (when the underlying asset is sold). Unlike taxes on wages, which are generally withheld as earned and must be paid annually, taxes on capital gains can be deferred by not selling the asset. The preferential tax treatment of capital gains contributes to growing disparity in wealth between White families and Black and Hispanic families. People with access to capital assets can benefit from <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-capital-gains-taxed">preferential rates</a> on assets held for more than one year before gains are realized; they can also benefit from the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-estate-gift-and-generation-skipping-transfer-taxes-work">“step-up in basis” provision</a>, which effectively exempts income tax on unrealized gains on assets held until death. Further, qualified dividends from corporate stock ownership also receive a preferential tax rate. These provisions will cost the federal government <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">over $700 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>.

Disparities in the value of corporate stocks and business equity, which generate a large share of <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51831">total net capital gains</a>, are even wider: in 2016, White families' holdings were three to four times higher in median value than those of Black and Hispanic families.

Social Security benefits are partially or completely tax exempt for beneficiaries whose income (including the Social Security benefits) is below a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/faqs/social-security-income">specific value</a>. The partial exclusion <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/individual-income-tax-expenditures-october-2018/t18-0149-tax-benefit-partial">primarily benefits middle-income older taxpayers</a>, because those with lower incomes pay little or no income tax regardless of the exclusion.

However, older adults of color tend to have lower average incomes, so their benefits may be more likely to be exempt from taxation. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_07-508.pdf">Lifetime benefit expectancy</a> also varies by race, with Black people on average receiving fewer years of Social Security benefits.

                  <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-kinds-tax-favored-retirement-arrangements-are-there">Retirement savings</a> are a crucial vehicle of wealth accumulation for many American families. Contributions to and earnings from assets in retirement plans are subject to preferential tax treatment. People with access to retirement plans (and with sufficient income to contribute to those plans) can accumulate greater savings, and the value of their assets grows effectively tax free over their lifetime.

                  In 2016, 60 percent of White families <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm">held retirement accounts</a> compared with 34 percent of Black families and 30 percent of Hispanic families. For families holding assets, the White-to-Black and White-to-Hispanic ratio in average value of retirement accounts has grown from twice to three times as high between 1989 and 2016.

Black and Hispanic households are less likely to be among the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hinc/hinc-01.html">highest-income households</a>, and they are therefore less likely to benefit.

                  The <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-child-tax-credit">child tax credit (CTC)</a> provides eligible taxpayers up to $2,000 for each child under age 17. Most families with children benefit, but the credit is reduced for taxpayers earning over $200,000 ($400,000 for joint filers). The credit is partially refundable (up to a maximum of $1,400), meaning families benefit even if they do not have any income tax liability. A $500 nonrefundable credit is available for those who may not qualify for the CTC (for example, because their child is 17 or older). Along with other smaller credits for <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-adoption-tax-credit">adoptions</a> and <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-tax-system-subsidize-child-care-expenses">child care expenses</a>, these provisions will altogether cost nearly <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">$500 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>. Further, low and middle-income taxpayers with children also <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/eitc-number-qualifying-children-ff09232019">disproportionately benefit</a> from the earned income tax credit.

Children of color are likelier to be in <a href="https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/44-children-in-poverty-by-race-and-ethnicity">conditions of poverty</a>: over one-quarter of Black, Hispanic, and Native American children were in families with incomes below the federal poverty level in 2018.

                  The earned income tax credit (EITC) provides income support to <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-earned-income-tax-credit">working taxpayers with low and moderate incomes</a>. Although it is available to taxpayers without children, the credit is far more generous for those with children; in 2019, eligible families with three or more children have a maximum credit amount of $6,557. Almost 90 percent of the credit’s total benefits accrue to <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/tax-benefit-earned-income-tax-credit/tax-benefit-earned-income-tax-credit-baseline">lower-income households</a>. The credit is one of the largest tax expenditures for the federal government, costing <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">almost $300 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>.

                <p>
                  Black and Hispanic households are disproportionately represented among lower-income households with children. In 2018, Black households constituted 14 percent of all households with children, but 22 percent of those with income below $55,000 (around the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/eitc-income-limits-maximum-credit-amounts-next-year">maximum adjusted gross income to qualify for the EITC</a>). Similarly, Hispanic households constituted about a third of all lower-income households with children, higher than their share of all households with children.

                  All businesses are not taxed the same way. “Pass-through” (or flow-through) businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, and S corporations, are not subject to corporate income tax. Instead, their profits are taxed as ordinary income for their individual owners. Pass-through businesses account for a rising share of <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-pass-through-businesses">total business returns</a>. <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-pass-through-businesses-taxed">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> created a new and temporary 20 percent deduction for certain forms of pass-through income that it is estimated to cost the federal government <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-business-tax-expenditures">more than $225 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>.

                  About 6.4 percent of White people reported self-employment income in 2018, compared with 6 percent of Hispanic people, 5 percent of Asian people, and 4.4 percent of Black people. But among those with at least some self-employment income, the average amounts reported varied widely: Asian people reported about $54,000 on average from nonfarm self-employment income, compared with $39,000 for White people, $36,000 for Hispanic people, and about $26,000 for Black people.

                  Various provisions in the federal income tax code encourage ownership of property beyond a primary home. These include tax preferences for certain investment property, rental housing, and agricultural activities. These provisions are relatively small in scope, but they are projected to cost the federal government <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/projected-income-tax-expenditure-budget">almost $60 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>.

                  Various tax incentives are available to subsidize health care costs, such as the exclusion for employer contributions to health insurance plans and the deduction for medical expenses. Altogether, these will reduce federal government revenues by about <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">$1.1 trillion between 2019 and 2022</a>, though the exclusion for employer contributions constitutes the bulk of that (and it does not appear on tax forms). <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">Almost half of total benefits</a> from the exclusion of employer-sponsored benefits and the deduction for self-employment health insurance premiums go to the top 20 percent of taxpayers by income.

                  The <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-tax-incentives-exist-help-families-pay-college-0">student loan interest deduction</a> allows certain taxpayers with qualified student loans to reduce their taxable income by the amount of loan interest they paid during the year, up to $2,500. Only taxpayers with adjusted gross income under $80,000 ($165,000 for joint filers) can use the deduction, and it costs the federal government about <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-tax-incentives-exist-higher-education">$2 billion each year</a>. The deduction is of no benefit to low-income families with zero income tax liability, so it <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/individual-income-tax-expenditures-october-2018/t18-0211-tax-benefit-education">largely benefits middle- to high-income families</a>.

                  Among undergraduate students in 2016, 15 percent of White students borrowed more than $26,500 for their education, compared with 21 percent of Black students and under 10 percent each for Hispanic and Asian students. However, Black and Hispanic families had a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm">debt-to-assets ratio</a> two to three times higher than that of White families, potentially raising their costs for future borrowing and the probability of defaulting.

                  Taxpayers can either take the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-standard-deduction">standard deduction</a> or claim <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-itemized-deductions-and-who-claims-them">itemized deductions</a> that are subtracted from their adjusted gross income to determine their taxable income. Itemized deductions include payments of state and local taxes, mortgage interest on owner-occupied residences, and charitable contributions. <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-did-tcja-change-standard-deduction-and-itemized-deductions">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> almost doubled the standard deduction and temporarily restricted several itemized deductions through 2025. Almost 90 percent of taxpayers took the standard deduction in 2018, while the number of itemizers dropped by <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/impact-itemized-deductions-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-jan-2018/t18-0002-impact-number">over half</a>.

                <p>
                  High-income households are <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/impact-itemized-deductions-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-jan-2018/t18-0004-impact-tax">more likely to benefit from itemized deductions</a>. Black and Hispanic households are underrepresented among high-income households: in 2018, they constituted 27 percent of all households but only 12 percent of households with income over $200,000. Low-income households, among which Black and Hispanic households are disproportionately represented, benefited from the expansion of the standard deduction.

                 Although any <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/anybody-can-itemize-their-deductions-most-dont-want">filer may choose to itemize</a>, benefits from itemizing go primarily to the top of the income distribution (which was true before the 2017 tax law as well). According to <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-effects-individual-income-tax-expenditures-after-2017-tax-cuts-and-jobs">Tax Policy Center estimates</a>, the top 1 percent of households by income, who are disproportionately less likely to be households of color, will receive over 40 percent of total benefits from itemizing in 2019. Altogether, adjusting for their interactivity, itemized deductions will cost the federal government <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-effects-individual-income-tax-expenditures-after-2017-tax-cuts-and-jobs">$70 billion in 2019</a>.

                  Taxpayers are allowed to take an itemized deduction for state and local taxes paid on income, sales, real estate, and personal property through the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-deduction-state-and-local-taxes-work">state and local tax (SALT) deduction</a>. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 instituted a temporary <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-deduction-state-and-local-taxes-work">$10,000 cap</a> on the annual deduction, and the number of claimants and average amount deducted fell. However, as is true of all itemized deductions, benefits primarily go to high-income households. According to Tax Policy Center estimates, taxpayers with income over $100,000 accrued <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/individual-income-tax-expenditures-october-2018/t18-0162-tax-benefit-itemized">90 percent of total benefits</a> from the SALT deduction in 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Black and Hispanic households constituted 27 percent of all households but only 16 percent of those with income over $100,000. SALT deduction benefits vary not just by income but also <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-tax-deduction-state">by state</a>; for example, the share of SALT deduction amounts claimed by taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $100,000 ranged from <a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-historic-table-2">70 percent in Texas</a> to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-historic-table-2">85 percent in California</a>, with Black and Hispanic households less likely to be among the high-income households in those states.

                <p>
                  The SALT deduction will cost the federal government around <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">$95 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>, dramatically less than the projected amount before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Benefits from the current SALT deduction, and benefits from itemizing deductions in general, primarily accrue to <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/individual-income-tax-expenditures-october-2018/t18-0163-tax-benefit-itemized">higher-income households</a>, who are less likely to be Black and Hispanic households.

                  The federal income tax code subsidizes homeownership through <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-tax-benefits-homeownership">tax incentives</a> such as the mortgage interest deduction, the deduction for state and local property taxes, and the exclusion of a portion of realized capital gains from the sale of a home. However, these provisions generally <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/do-existing-tax-incentives-increase-homeownership">have not increased homeownership rates</a>; they instead have made it likelier that taxpayers buy larger homes by taking on more debt. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limited the tax benefits from the mortgage interest and property tax deductions by making itemizing less beneficial overall. However, this also means that <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">high-income households</a> who continue to itemize will see an increased share of the remaining benefits. Altogether, homeownership tax provisions will cost the federal government <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">more than $280 billion between 2019 and 2022</a>.

Further, <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/2017/ahs-2017-summary-tables.html">monthly housing costs</a> constituted more than half of household income for higher shares of Black, Hispanic, and Asian households than for White households.

                  The federal tax code <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-tax-treatment-charitable-contributions">subsidizes charitable giving</a> by allowing individual taxpayers to claim an itemized deduction for contributions of cash, financial assets, real estate, and property such as clothing to qualifying tax-exempt organizations. This tax incentive lowers the net cost of gifts and has historically subsidized about <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-large-are-individual-income-tax-incentives-charitable-giving">60 percent of total charitable giving</a>. But this itemized deduction does not benefit the vast majority of households taking the standard deduction. <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/21-million-taxpayers-will-stop-taking-charitable-deduction-under-tcja">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> lowered the marginal tax benefit of charitable giving by reducing both the number of itemizers and income tax rates.

                  The amount taxpayers owe is determined by their income, filing status, and eligible credits and deductions. <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> significantly changed the income tax system by lowering marginal individual income tax rates, expanding the standard deduction, eliminating the personal exemption, increasing the child tax credit, and introducing a deduction for some pass-through income. Most of the individual income tax changes are temporary and set to expire at the end of 2025. Overall, the Tax Policy Center estimates that about <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/full">80 percent of taxpayers</a> got a tax cut in 2018; about 5 percent saw a tax increase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The top 20 percent of taxpayers by income (or those with over $149,400) accrued 65 percent of total benefits in 2018 from the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-dec-2017/t17-0312-conference-agreement">2017 tax law changes</a>. Black and Hispanic households make up 27 percent of all households, but constitute only 14 percent of households with over $150,000.

                  Overall, federal income taxes are <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/are-federal-taxes-progressive">progressive</a>, meaning that the average income tax burden tends to increase with income. Therefore, federal income taxes help <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-income-inequality">reduce income inequality</a> and racial income gaps.

        <h4>About the data</h4>
          <p>
            This feature highlights how certain individual income tax provisions interact with racial disparities by describing various tax provisions and presenting data on related demographic and economic factors. The data on related factors is sourced from public survey datasets, primarily from the Annual Social and Economic Supplements of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/data-detail.html">Current Population Survey</a> by the US Census Bureau and the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm">Survey of Consumer Finances</a> by the Federal Reserve Board and estimates of provision costs and distributional effects from the Tax Policy Center’s (TPC's) Microsimulation model of the Federal Tax System. Other data sources include the US Census Bureau&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html">American Community Survey</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/detailed-estimates.html">Annual Estimates of the Resident Population</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ase.html">Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs</a>, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/housing/housing_vacancy_survey.html">Housing Vacancy Survey</a>, the US Department of Education&rsquo;s <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/overview-of-ipeds-data">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System</a> and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas/about.asp">National Postsecondary Student Aid Study</a>, the US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/nvsr.htm">National Vital Statistics Reports</a> and <a href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging and Disability in America/2018OlderAmericansProfile.pdf">Profile of Older Americans</a>, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/ahar/#2018-reports">Annual Homeless Assessment Report</a>, Indiana University’s <a href="https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/research/current-research/philanthropy-panel-study.html">Philanthropy Panel Study</a>, and the Pew Research Center&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/us-unauthorized-immigrant-population-2017/">immigrant population estimates</a>. Definitions and descriptions of most provisions are sourced from the TPC <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book">Briefing Book</a>, while the distributional estimates by income are sourced from TPC&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/resources/brief-description-tax-model">microsimulation model estimates</a>. Estimates of forgone revenue are based on TPC&rsquo;s analysis of <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/what-are-largest-nonbusiness-tax-expenditures">tax expenditures</a> data from the <a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5148">Joint Committee on Taxation</a> and the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/tax-policy/tax-expenditures">Treasury</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on data availability, we collected demographic and economic information at <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/subject-definitions.html">varying levels of analysis</a>, including individual persons, households, and families and note where different units are used for comparative purposes. These are not the same as <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/resources/tpcs-microsimulation-model-faq">tax units</a>, which are individuals or married couples that file a tax return or would file a tax return if their income were high enough, along with all dependents. In general, the number of tax units tends to be smaller than the number of individual people but larger than the number of families or households.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Data on pretax income can vary by source based on what is included, and these differences generally cannot be reconciled because of data constraints. For example, TPC uses <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/resources/income-measure-used-distributional-analyses-tax-policy-center">“expanded cash income”</a> in distributing tax benefits and liabilities across tax units, which includes cash income, tax-exempt employee and employer contributions to health insurance and other fringe benefits, employer contributions to tax-preferred retirement accounts, income earned within retirement accounts, and food stamps. The Current Population Survey, on the other hand, uses <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/data/data-tools/cps-table-creator-help/income-definitions.html">“money income,”</a> which includes wages and salaries, interest and dividend income, rent and royalties income, pensions and annuities, child support, and public assistance cash benefits, but not noncash benefits such as food stamps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the data we present by race may not be consistent across sources in terms of self-identification and definitions. Sufficient data on income and wealth sources is not available for all major race or ethnicity categories. This is particularly true for the Native American (American Indian/Alaska Native) population, which constitutes about 2.5 percent of the total population. It is important to further research tax and nontax disparities for Native Americans.
          </p>
          <p>
            We classify Current Population Survey data based on the self-identification of each respondent (or the household reference person to whom the relationship of other people in the household is recorded) as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Asian: Asian alone and no other race reported.</li>
              <li>Black: Black alone and no other race reported.</li>
              <li>Hispanic: Hispanic or a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.</li>
              <li>White: non-Hispanic White alone and no other race reported.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
           We classify Survey of Consumer Finances data based on the self-identification of a family's original respondent as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Black: non-Hispanic Black or African American.</li>
              <li>Hispanic: Hispanic or Latino.</li>
              <li>Other: Asian, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, other race, or more than one racial identification.</li>
              <li>White: non-Hispanic White.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, tax provisions discussed here are not exhaustive, and other specific line items or tax benefits have disparate impacts by race or ethnicity. In particular, we do not consider the racial implications from other federal taxes, such as excise or estate taxes, or state and local taxes including income, property, and general and specific sales taxes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In discussing how aspects of the individual income tax code interact with nontax racial inequities, we are not suggesting that the Internal Revenue Service or the federal government is targeting tax provisions to benefit or harm people of color. In fact, federal income taxes are <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/are-federal-taxes-progressive">progressive</a>, overall; those with higher incomes pay a larger share of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes, which can help close racial income gaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this feature, we treat tax provisions as specific and separate tax policy choices with their own sets of disparate impacts based on eligibility criteria, benefits, or liabilities. Overall, our goal is to illustrate how the tax system and specific tax provisions may have disparate impacts by race or other demographic factors. We encourage others to pursue these topics of research and broaden debates on these important public policies.
